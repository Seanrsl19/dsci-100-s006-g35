    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Videogames are a valuable source of data for studying human behavior and online interaction. At the University of British Columbia, a research group led by Professor Frank Wood has created a Minecraft-based research server designed to collect such data. Here, players's actions are continuosly logged as they explore the game. That said, managig the server presents serverall logististical challenges. Namely, the research team must ensure that they have enough hardware and software resources to handle peak player loads, and must also prioritize recruitment of participants who are likely to contribute meaningful amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we investigate the relationship between player experience level, age, and the total number of hours played. Specifically, we aim to answer the question:\n",
    "**How does player experience level and age influence the total number of hours played?** We believe that understanding this relationship can help the research team better predict which players are likely to engage deeply with the server over time, enabling them to recruit more effectively and plan resources accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore this question, we use the players.csv dataset which contains information about information about a variety of player demographics as well as each player's experience level, engagement with the server, and subscription status. We have also included the sessions.csv dataset, which contains informataion about individual players' sessions on the server, to support further analysis."
